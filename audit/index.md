title: Gender Audit
digest: "Some basic numbers on gender (in)equality in my community"
---
Since 2011 I have made occasional forays into gender auditing as a way of paying attention to my position in the remarkably unequal field of contemporary music composition. My attempts were occasional — a couple of analyses of my immediate environments in recognition of International Women’s Day, some (perhaps brash) comments upon finding myself programmed on all-male concerts — and their irregularity was problematic.

What follows below is the result of restructuring this site. I have built gender auditing into my event listing manager, so these numbers will always be the most recent reflection of the community as I participate in it. These aren’t exhaustive numbers. My performance context is not representative of *all* of contemporary music. Gender inequality is far more complex than a tally of whose music is performed. Gender audits do little to help reveal the causes of inequality. However, I do believe that at the very least they are a reminder of the work to do, and for any doubters, proof of a very real imbalance and an aid in strategic “gender mainstreaming”.[^1]
