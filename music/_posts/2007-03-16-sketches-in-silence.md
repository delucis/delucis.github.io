My first work to be performed in the UK after arriving there to study, _Sketches in Silence_ is an intensely quiet experiment in performance and the relationship between musicians’ gestures and sound. It consists of large amounts of silence (including silent gestures), white noise and very occasional flickers of pitched material. I later wrote [more about this work and silence](/2010/04/a-stillness-on-the-ear/) after finishing [_Wege & Waldstille_](/2010/04/wegen-und-waldstille/) in 2010.
