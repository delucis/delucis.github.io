Materials towards a performance for four people.

*rumour  —  distant land* provides a framework for a performance that is as much visual and dramatic as it is sonic, allowing four performers to present a series of images and actions, all of which touch around but never upon feelings of distance, loss, reminiscence and the mundane.
