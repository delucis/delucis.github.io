> there is all of the activity that occurs from the feeling of your body bisected, your eyes bisected, the time in which you were sitting, there is the fact that space has changed, that history has been opened (this line comes from the past).

> â€” Renee Gladman, [_Calamities_][cs]

_this line comes from the past_ was commissioned by
[impuls . International Ensemble and Composers Academy for Contemporary Music][imp], Graz, Austria, and was premiered at impuls 2019 by Klangforum Wien.

A short statement I wrote for the Klangforum season catalogue can be found [on their website][kf].
