> At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless; \\
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is, \\
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity, \\
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards, \\
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point, \\
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.

A tiny little piece, _still point_ is a kind of interstitial, false silence written as an interjection to Heinz Holliger’s _Mobile_ for oboe and harp, a work with an open form consisting of 12 modules. It was written at the request of the [Orfea Duo](https://web.archive.org/web/20130331034531/http://orfea.co.uk/) for their ‘Mobile Project’.
