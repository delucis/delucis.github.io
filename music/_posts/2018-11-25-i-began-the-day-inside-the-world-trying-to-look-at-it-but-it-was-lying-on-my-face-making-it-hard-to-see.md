The title of this piece comes from Renee Gladman’s collection of short texts [_Calamities_][cs] (Wave Books, 2016). _Calamities_ presents a series of prose poems that move between crystalline geometric metaphors for our place in the world — “You were in a field, an unidentified country, and all the lines were illuminated and lifted out of the ground” — to meditations on corporeality in the ethereal world of written text — “…writing was the story of the body in thought” — to the kind of simultaneously insightful and humorous phrases represented by the line I borrow for my title. I am trying to think about proximity and distance to the world as mediated through the text and imagery I consume — perhaps excessively or even obsessively — every day. We can be brought close to the far away by news reports and photography, but as Gladman’s line suggests, proximity can paradoxically also make it hard to see.

_I began the day inside the world trying to look at it, but it was lying on my face, making it hard to see._ was commissioned by Philharmonie Luxembourg and received its first performance by [ensemble mosaik][em] at [Rainy Days 2018][rd]. I am grateful for the knowing and unknowing support of James Bean, Renee Gladman, Clara Iannotta, Bettina Junge, Lydia Rilling, and Zeynep Toraman in realising this project.
