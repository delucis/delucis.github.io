Some words that I had nearby while writing this piece (courtesy of Roger Deakin, C.D. Wright, Seamus Heaney and Friedrich Dürrenmatt):

> Daydreaming has been my making and my undoing —
like having a light at your back you can’t see but can still feel.

> ‘Since when,’ he asked,
‘Are the first and last line of any poem
where the poem begins and ends?’

> Nur noch die Geige Einsteins ist zu hören.

The title is taken from a statement made by John Cage shortly before his death, in an interview with Charles Amirkhanian:

> We live in a time I think not of mainstream but of many streams or even, if you insist on a river of time, that we have come to delta, maybe even beyond delta to an ocean which is going back to the skies.

Written for [Trio Atem](http://www.myspace.com/trioatem), _…going back to the skies_ had its first performance in a ‘beat the rush hour’ concert on February 26 2010 in the Cosmo Rodewald Concert Hall at the University of Manchester. The concert featured several new works by Manchester-based composers commissioned for the occasion.

A revised version of this work was premiered by Trio Atem at King’s Place on Monday, 4 April 2011.
