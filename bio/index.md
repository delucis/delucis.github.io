In my music I hope to open up doors to worlds that might otherwise not exist,
drawing together material contexts for human performers that are resistant and
require collaborative effort. I am interested in working with unstable and
contingent situations that both demand response and afford freedom to those
involved. For example, my string quartet [_union–seam_][u-s] asks performers to
share an instrument, at times producing a single sound through communal action,
staging an intimate responsiveness to one another and their instrument’s
resonance.

Since 2013, I have been a student in the doctoral programme at
Harvard University (USA) where my dissertation committee includes Profs. Chaya
Czernowin, Vijay Iyer, and Hans Tutschku. I studied on the ‘Cursus 1’ programme
at IRCAM (France), supported by an Entente Cordiale Scholarship, and at the
University of Manchester (UK) where I received Bachelors and Masters degrees in
music and composition, studying with Ricardo Climent. Other important musical
encounters have included discussions with Pierluigi Billone, Michael Pisaro,
Rebecca Saunders, Steven Kazuo Takasugi, and Jennifer Walshe and work with the
musicians of the JACK Quartet, ensemble mosaik, soundinitiative, Talea
Ensemble, Trio Atem, and Yarn/Wire, amongst many others.

In addition to my compositional work, I have worked as a teaching assistant to
Profs. Claire Chase, George Lewis, and Hans Tutschku, covering improvised and
experimental music, studio composition, and collaborative creative practice.
I developed [a suite of pedagogical tools][264] for teaching creative audio
programming and have worked regularly as a technical assistant to the composer
Clara Iannotta. Fall 2018 saw the publication of [a special issue of _CR: The
New Centennial Review_ on music and critical theory][cr], co-edited with
philosopher Irving Goh.
