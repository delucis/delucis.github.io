## {{ page.title }}

I work with various permutations of instrumental and electronic resources, mainly focusing on creating musical experiences with a relatively fixed structure (be that scored or on tape). I am interested in the performance experience in terms of the human exchange between performer and audience member, and with each work hope to open up doors to worlds that might otherwise not exist.

I studied on the ‘Cursus 1’ programme at IRCAM (France), supported by an Entente Cordiale Scholarship, and at the University of Manchester (UK) where I received Bachelors and Masters degrees in music and composition, studying with Ricardo Climent. In September 2013, I joined the doctoral programme at Harvard University (USA) where I study with Chaya Czernowin. Other important musical encounters have included discussions with Pierluigi Billone, Martin Iddon, Rebecca Saunders and Steven Kazuo Takasugi, and work with the musicians of soundinitiative, Talea Ensemble and Trio Atem amongst many others.
