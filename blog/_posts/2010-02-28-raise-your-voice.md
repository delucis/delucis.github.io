Over the last few months, along with friends [Rob Guy](http://www.robert-guy.com/) and [Steve Pycroft](http://www.stevepycroft.com/), I've been involved in setting up new music ensemble and composers' collective [Raise Your Voice](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/). I'm really pleased to be able to announce our launch night will be on 28 February 2010 in Centro Bar, doors opening around 19:30. The night will feature new music by Manchester-based composers performed by the Raise Your Voice Ensemble of superb young players, plus a laptop set, improvisation with live electronics and DJs. See the [Raise Your Voice website](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/) for details of the night, full programme and information about everybody involved.

A new piece of mine, [_This is Water!_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2010/02/this-is-water/), will be performed by the full ensemble of flute, clarinet, percussion, string quartet and electronics as part of this Sunday evening concert.
