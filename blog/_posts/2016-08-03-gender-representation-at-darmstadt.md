To complement the [‘Gender Relations in Darmstadt’ panel](http://www.internationales-musikinstitut.de/en/program2016/319-03-08-2016/1957-panel-fure-en.html) put together by Ashley Fure at this year’s International Summer Course for New Music Darmstadt, I put together [a visual overview of gender balances at concerts at this year’s festival](http://darmstadt-2016.netlify.com/).

Even more interestingly, Fure collected the data from Darmstadt’s archives on [gender representation across the years](https://griddarmstadt.wordpress.com/2016/08/06/facts/), and [the official GRID Blog](https://griddarmstadt.wordpress.com/) includes various other articles and resources.
