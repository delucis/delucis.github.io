Tape piece [_Para cruzar el sueño_](/2010/02/para-cruzar-el-sueno-2/), which I wrote last autumn at the [NOVARS Research Centre](http://www.novars.manchester.ac.uk), was premiered as part of the Spring 2010 MANTIS Festival at the University of Manchester on Sunday 21st February at 2:00 pm. I also played cello on the Saturday night in the First MANTIS Battle of Improvised Music: Voice, acoustic instruments and electronics, which was a lot of fun. We mainly played randomly selected trios, but finished with a mass improv directed by Gavin Osborn. Here's a video of that:
