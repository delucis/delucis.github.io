I will be performing/appearing/being at [A Curious Night](http://www.myspace.com/acuriousnight) at the Nip & Tipple in Whalley Range the evening of Monday 13th September. Put together by composer Nina Whiteman and performance artist Michael Mayhew, it will include an eclectic range of performances, happenings and a ‘curious vegetable competition’, spurred on by Nabokov’s suggestion that ‘curiosity is insubordination in its purest form’. My contributions will include an audience improvisation piece with electronic atmosphere, titled _Quiet Games_, and an improvised performance on the cello. Come along, it should be intriguing.
