My piece for nine strings, [_Excavations_](/2009/03/excavations-2/), drawing inspiration from 350 year-old Henry Purcell's fantazias that was workshopped by the [Manchester Camerata](http://www.manchestercamerata.com/) in October of last year and has since been heavily revised, was given a brilliant first performance at [Vaganza](http://www.vaganza.manchester.ac.uk) New Music Day [_Deserts and Canyons: John McCabe at 70_](http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/martinharriscentre/mhceventspage.php?eventid=644) under the baton of [Robert Guy](http://www.robert-guy.com/). **Click [here](/2009/03/excavations-2/) to listen to a recording from that concert.**
