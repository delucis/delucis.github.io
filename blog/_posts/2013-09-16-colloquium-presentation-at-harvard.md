I have recently joined the PhD programme at [Harvard University](http://www.music.fas.harvard.edu/) to study with [Chaya Czernowin](http://chayaczernowin.com/) and [Hans Tutschku](http://www.tutschku.com/), which is going to take up a substantial chunk of my life for the next six or so years.

Throughout the year the [Harvard Group for New Music](http://hgnm.org/) organises a series of presentations by current students, plus occasional guests, to open up opportunities for discussion and group critique. In order to introduce myself to the community, I am presenting today at 12pm and will talk about and play my recent music, and discuss problems I am currently facing in my work.
