Over the last few years I have been working with [Irving Goh][goh] on a [special issue of _CR: The New Centennial Review_][issue] and it is finally online. It brings together statements by composers [Joanna Bailie][bai], [Tatiana Catanzaro][cat], [Carolyn Chen][chen], [Ashley Fure][fure], and [Fabien Lévy][levy] alongside essays on music by Claire Colebrook, Jeffrey Di Leo, Jeremy Braddock and Timothy Morton, Jean-Luc Nancy, Naomi Waltham-Smith, and Holly Watkins. It also includes my own text, [‘Who Vibrates?,’][wv] which tries to think about Carolyn Chen’s music and how New Materialist theories of vibration, vibrancy, and animation intersect with colonial histories of race and subjecthood.

I am very grateful to all our contributors who took the time to make this collection possible and to Irving for including me in the project.

You can find the issue on [Project Muse][issue], [JSTOR][jstor], or directly from [Michigan State University Press][msup]. Some of the papers (or their drafts) are also available from open access sources and I’ll try to keep this list updated as others come online:
