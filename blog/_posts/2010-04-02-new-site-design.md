**NB: This post refers to [a _previous_ site re-design](http://v2.chrisswithinbank.net).**

Welcome to a new look website. Please glance around and [get in touch](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/contact/) or leave a comment if you see anything that looks broken. I am still tinkering with things, so things might change, and there should be sections with audio and video up at some point in the future. Any other feedback is also welcome.

If you are so inclined, take a look at the [colophon](http://v2.chrisswithinbank.net/colophon/) for details of what makes this site tick.

If you can't find something that used to be here, have a root around in [the archived version of the old site](http://v1.chrisswithinbank.net). I think that's all working as it used to. If you have an old link you want to keep using, just put `v1` where you might expect `www` to be and you should end up in the right place.
