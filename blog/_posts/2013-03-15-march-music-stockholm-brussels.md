I’m lucky enough to be finishing this month with two concerts. On 22 March, the [Curious Chamber Players](http://www.curiouschamberplayers.com/) will perform [_The Incredulity of St Thomas_](/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/) as part of Samtida Musik’s [Vårflod Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20160130181612/http://samtidamusik.se/samtid/sv/konsert/v-rflod-garth-knox-och) in Stockholm. The rest of the programme features recent works by Swedish composers and the concert is followed by a recital given by Garth Knox.

**Listings:** [Vårflod Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20160130181612/http://samtidamusik.se/samtid/sv/konsert/v-rflod-garth-knox-och)

Two days later, [soundinitiative](http://soundinitiative.fr/) will give their second performance of my most recent piece, [_All that is solid melts into air_](/2013/01/all-that-is-solid-melts-into-air/), at the [What’s Next Festival](http://www.arsmusica.be/2013/dut/concert/24-03-(2)-festival-what-s-next/) in Brussels. The concert will also include the second performance of Joanna Bailie’s _Artificial Environment Nos. 9a–d_ and Rebecca Saunders’s _Molly’s Song #3 — shades of crimson_, which they played with intensity and subtlety in February, so don’t miss it!
