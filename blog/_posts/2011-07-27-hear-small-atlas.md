Two weeks ago, Mario Caroli, Pierre-Stéphane Meugé, Donatienne-Michel Dansac and Vincent Leterme gave the premiere of my new piece for flute, soprano saxophone, voice and piano, [_Small Atlas_](/2011/05/small-atlas/), as part of the closing concerts for the [Acanthes 2011](http://www.acanthes.com/) composition workshops. Their rendition was crisp, extremely clear and — unsurprisingly — far more integrated than ‘clean’ recordings made earlier in the week. Here it is for you to listen to at your leisure. I recommend the [free download](http://hear.chrisswithinbank.net/track/small-atlas) as the streaming audio seems to do something funny to saxophone multiphonics.
