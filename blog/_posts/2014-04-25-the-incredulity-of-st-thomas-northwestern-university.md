This weekend I am travelling to Chicago to take part in the [NUNC! Conference](http://www.music.northwestern.edu/academics/new-music/nunc.html) at Northwestern University. There’s a full schedule of concerts, presentations, and masterclasses, including a performance of my piece [_The Incredulity of St Thomas_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/) by [Ensemble Dal Niente](http://dalniente.com/). See the full schedule [here](http://www.music.northwestern.edu/academics/new-music/nunc.html#schedule).
