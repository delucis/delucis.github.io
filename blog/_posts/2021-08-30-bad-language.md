"I bought a fog"  
to consternation say

Across the lab a perplex gaze  
But

He can't tell  
If it was me or something fatter  
That brokered language to this point

I hear that they are ceding rain over Siberia  
And at the lake  
Hourly clouds draw crowds

All I wanted was to brew tea

and speak my joy  
But  
A wait of coin is falling from the sky
