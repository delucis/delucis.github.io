At the start of last month, [Trio Atem](http://www.myspace.com/trioatem) gave a wonderful performance of my _[…going back to the skies](/2010/02/back-to-the-skies/)_ as part of the [‘Out Hear’ series at Kings Place](http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/out-hear). Here is a recording of the performance for all to hear. As always, thanks to Gavin, Nina and Alice!
