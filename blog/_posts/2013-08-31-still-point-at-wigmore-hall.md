On Wednesday, 4 September, the [Orfea Duo](https://web.archive.org/web/20130331034531/http://orfea.co.uk/) — Mea Wade (oboe) & Olivia Jageurs (harp) — will present a curious programme at London’s Wigmore Hall built around Heinz Holliger’s 1962 open-form work _Mobile_. This modular and reconfigurable work comes in 12 bits and it will be presented intermingled with 12 new matching miniatures, including my (tiny) [_still point_](/2013/08/still-point/).

The concert is private, but I have two invitations to give away. Leave me a tweet [@swithinbank](https://twitter.com/swithinbank){:rel='me'} or a comment below, and on Monday evening I’ll pick someone at random to go along.
