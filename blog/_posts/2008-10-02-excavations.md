A recently completed string piece, [_Excavations_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2009/03/excavations-2/), drawing on Purcell's Fantazia in A minor (Z. 740) was workshopped by the [Manchester Camerata](http://www.manchestercamerata.com/) and Clark Rundell on October 2nd as part of the Camerata's Young Composers' Project.
