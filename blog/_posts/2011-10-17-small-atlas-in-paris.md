This Saturday, Paris’s newest new music ensemble [soundinitiative](http://www.soundinitiative.fr) will perform my [_Small Atlas_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2011/05/small-atlas/) in an afternoon recital at the [Conservatoire de Saint-Cloud](http://www.conservatoiresaintcloud.com). The performers in my piece are [Paolo Vignaroli](http://www.paolovignaroli.com/), [Joshua Hyde](http://www.joshuahyde.com), Fabienne Séveillac and Shira Legmann. There’s a really great programme lined up with music by Salvatore Sciarrino, Giacinto Scelsi, Julien Malaussena, Yoshifumi Tanaka and [Simon Steen-Andersen](http://www.simonsteenandersen.dk/), so if you’re in the Paris area, you should definitely try and make it.

For me it’s a first to hear the same piece played three times in fairly quick succession by three different groups of musicians — a real pleasure. See you there!
