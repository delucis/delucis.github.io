At the end of October, sparked by a post by Ian Pace, a heated debate took place on Facebook around the protest action of [Johannes Kreidler](http://www.kreidler-net.de/) against the fusion of the radio orchestras at Baden-Baden/Freiburg and Stuttgart, which Kreidler performed at this year’s Donaueschingen Festival. Having consulted the contributors, Pace subsequently [posted the full discussion on his blog](http://ianpace.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/the-johannes-kreidler-protest-at-donaueschingen-about-the-fusion-of-the-radio-orchestras-at-baden-badenfreiburg-and-stuttgart-a-discussion-from-facebook/), a positive move, which reinforces the idea that social media may be becoming a valid arena for public debate.

I found both clicking through the posts on Facebook and reading through the discussion on Ian’s blog somewhat tiring and visually confusing, so put together [a formatted PDF of the discussion](/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kreidlerdebate.pdf) to ease my reading. I thought this may prove useful to others, so here it is to distribute as anyone sees fit.

_**Update, 30/11:** The [Gesellschaft für Neue Musik](http://www.g-n-m.de/), the organisation which commissioned Johannes Kreidler’s performance, have released a statement regarding this discussion, which you can [read over on Ian Pace’s blog](http://ianpace.wordpress.com/2012/11/30/statement-from-the-gesellschaft-fur-neue-musik-concerning-the-kreidler-protest-at-donaueschingen/)._
