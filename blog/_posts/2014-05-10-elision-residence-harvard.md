This week, [ELISION Ensemble](http://www.elision.org.au/) will be in residence at Harvard University, culminating on Saturday 17 May in a concert of new music by graduate composers at Harvard that will also include the US première of [Richard Barrett](http://richardbarrettmusic.com/)’s [_Lens_](http://vimeo.com/72911962), for flugelhorn and electric lap-steel guitar.

Ensembles that undertake their work and perform with the integrity and intensity of ELISION are rare, so it will be an eye-opening experience having them here. My [short experiment for them](/2014/04/traveller-standing-in-rooms-i-ii/) is for electric lap-steel guitar and a strange quintet of oboe, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, trumpet and trombone. Come along on Saturday to hear more!
