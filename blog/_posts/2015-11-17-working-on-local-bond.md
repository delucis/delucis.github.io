This Wednesday and Thursday there are chances to hear graduate musicians from Stony Brook University performing [*local bond*][37145b70] — music for four musicians collaboratively playing a set-up including viola, cello, and various other tools. The concerts are in [Stony Brook][f6d0114d] and at [Roulette in Brooklyn][81f8e483], and also feature pieces by Piers Hellawell, Paula Matthusen, Erin Rogers, and James Wood. Would be lovely to see you there!
