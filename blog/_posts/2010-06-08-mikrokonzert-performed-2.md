Alice Purton with new music ensemble [Vaganza](http://www.vaganza.manchester.ac.uk/) will give the second performance of my micro cello concerto [_Mikrokonzert: I Swear I Saw the Sun Falling_](/2009/06/mikrokonzert-2/) at the Royal Northern College of Music on the evening of Tuesday 8th June. The concert is part of a two-day festival celebrating the music of Alexander Goehr and also includes new works by [Tom Coult](http://www.tomcoult.com/) and [David Curington](http://www.davidcurington.com/) as well as _Sing, Ariel_ by Goehr himself.
