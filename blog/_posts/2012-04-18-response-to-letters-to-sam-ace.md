*[Download a PDF](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Letter-concerning-Sound-and-Music-with-signatories2.pdf) of the letter with a full list of signatories*

On 27 March, two open letters [[1](http://www.holstfoundation.org/index.php?pr=Open_Letter_to_SAM_and_ACE), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20120401042518/http://www.rhinegold.co.uk/magazines/classical_music/news/classical_music_news_story.asp?id=1380)] to [Sound and Music](http://www.soundandmusic.org/) and [Arts Council England](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/) were made public, criticising both organisations for their activities since the former of these was founded from a merger of the Society for the Promotion of New Music, the British Music Information Centre, Sonic Arts Network and the Contemporary Music Network in 2008. The letters, signed by various respected composers and musicians at various stages in their careers, have provoked lively debate, but the undersigned are concerned both by its tone and by certain assumptions made by the letters’ signatories. It has also been alarming to see well-known members of SAM staff and board, whose own work covers notated instrumental music as well as electronic and electroacoustic musics, personally described in derogatory terms in the ensuing debate.

Both letters criticise Sound and Music’s promotion of sound art and other music, describing these areas as ‘fringe activities which have little or no connection with the mainstream’. In so doing, the signatories appear to assert that notated, contemporary composition should receive a specially privileged status within Sound and Music’s activities, whilst at the same time failing to acknowledge the considerable amount of work the organisation has in any case undertaken in this field. In a time when musicians and composers increasingly work across genres and media and defy simplistic categorisation, it is divisive and unhelpful to seek to separate any one strand of contemporary music and sound from others or to plead for special treatment. Indeed, notated contemporary composition is itself a ‘fringe activity’, in the sense of being a small minority pursuit. But minority pursuits perceived to have wider significance and potential should be encouraged and supported; part of the purpose of public subsidy is surely to do this, whether for notated contemporary music, sound art, or any other forms of music.

As Sound and Music themselves recognised in [their response](http://www.soundandmusic.org/about/press/response-to-open-letter) to the recent debate, the transitional period since the merger has been a difficult one and in many ways the organisation is still finding its feet, a task made more challenging by the 42% funding cut from Arts Council England last year. In discussing how to secure a positive future for and greater awareness of British music both at home and abroad — a task in which Sound and Music has an undoubtedly vital role — the musical community should be as open-minded and supportive as possible of all their colleagues, and be prepared to embrace possibilities for widening the range of creative work produced, rather than restricting it to that already firmly established. It is by working together and interacting with each other, rather than ghettoisation or jealous guarding of limited conceptions of new music, that we will build a stronger and more successful community, and make possible that which is genuinely 'new'.
