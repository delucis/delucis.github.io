Here is a video from the first performance of [_always extra folds of birds of paper and you could move your finger along the length of them and have witnesses_](http://chrisswithinbank.net/2017/02/always-extra-folds-of-birds-of-paper-and-you-could-move-your-finger-along-the-length-of-them-and-have-witnesses/) by [Yarn/Wire](http://yarnwire.org/).

This would not have been possible without the hard work of Yarn/Wire’s [Ian Antonio](http://www.ianantonio.com/), [Laura Barger](https://laurabarger.com/) and [Russell Greenberg](http://www.russellgreenberg.net/), guest performer [Eric Wubbels](http://www.wubbelsmusic.com/), and amplification performer [James Bean](http://www.jamesbean.info/). Thank you also to [Jerry MacDonald](http://www.oddfellowsrecording.com/) (audio recording engineer), [Manuela Meier](http://mm.mur.at/) (cameras), and [Clara Iannotta](http://claraiannotta.com/) (lighting). I am always grateful to Renee Gladman for her [_Calamities_](https://www.wavepoetry.com/products/calamities) from which I borrow the title for this piece.

If you would prefer to just listen to the piece, there’s [an alternate take without the video on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/swithinbank/always-extra-folds-yarn-wire):
