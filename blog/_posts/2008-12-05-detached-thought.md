Trio Atem (flute, voice and cello) gave a fantastic premiere of [_Detached Thought #100_](/2008/12/intensifications/) - a setting of a brief journal entry by Lord Byron - as part of the University of Manchester's [Interdisciplinary Byron Conference](http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/subjectareas/englishamericanstudies/research/byroncentre/), 4-5 December 2008. The lunchtime concert included various settings of Byron's writings by students at the University, bringing to an end two days of presentations and discussions on the problems of adapting Byron's works.
