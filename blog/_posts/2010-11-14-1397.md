> […] and every attempt \\
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure \\
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words \\
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which \\
One is no longer disposed to say it. […]

— T.S. Eliot, ‘East Coker’, [Four Quartets](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/four-quartets/9780571068944)
