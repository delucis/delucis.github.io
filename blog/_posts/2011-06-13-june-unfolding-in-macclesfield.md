This Saturday sees the first performance of [_June Unfolding_](/2011/04/june-unfolding/) by the orchestra of [King Edward Musical Society](http://www.kems.org.uk/) in Macclesfield as part of the Barnaby Festival marking the 750th anniversary of the Royal Charter of Macclesfield. It seems like only yesterday that I first met the orchestra, but months down the line, here we are and rehearsals have been going very well. Alongside my piece the programme includes Shostakovich’s _Festive Overture_, Beethoven Violin Concerto (performed by the orchestra’s leader, Melissa Court), the Apotheosis/Triumphal March from Berlioz’s _Grand symphonie funèbre et triomphale_, and _A New Song’s Measure_ for choir and concert band by Irish composer [Fergal Carroll](http://cmc.ie/composers/composer.cfm?composerID=158).

You can find out more about _June Unfolding_ [on the Adopt a Composer blog](http://www.adoptacomposer.org/2011/04/unfolding-musical-memory/). Many thanks go to the organisations that supported this commission — [Sound and Music](http://www.soundandmusic.org/), [PRS for Music Foundation](http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com/) and [Making Music](http://www.makingmusic.org.uk/) — but also to all the members of the orchestra, conductor Tony Houghton and KEMS chairman Tim Ward.
