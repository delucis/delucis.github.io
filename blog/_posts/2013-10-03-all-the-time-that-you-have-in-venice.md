Unfortunately, I’m not getting any time at all in Venice, but this Sunday, 6 October, my [_All the time that you have what we have. / All the time that you have._](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/09/all-the-time-that-you-have-what-we-have-all-the-time-that-you-have/) will be [part of a concert at the Biennale di Venezia](http://www.labiennale.org/it/musica/programma/docfiles/nu-thing-maurice.html) curated by Italian blogger-composer collective [/nu/thing](http://www.nuthing.eu/).

The performers are soprano [Laura Catrani](http://www.lauracatrani.com/) and violinists Georgia Privitera & Laura Bertolino of [Quartetto Maurice](http://www.quartettomaurice.com/). The programme also includes works by [Kristian Ireland](http://www.kristianireland.com/), [Emanuele Casale](http://emanuelecasale.wordpress.com/), Valerio Murat, [Simon Steen-Andersen](http://www.simonsteenandersen.dk/), [Aurélio Edler-Copes](http://www.edler-copes.com/) and [Mario Diaz de León](http://www.ikatmethod.com/). Wish I could be there![^nuthingnote]

[^nuthingnote]: I’m happy to be included, but I should note that it’s always disappointing to be involved in a concert of only male composers organised by a collective of only male composers.
