I am visiting the USA to attend the [Harvard Summer Composition Institute](http://summercompositioninstitute.org/) and arrived in New York on Friday night. During the Composition Institute I will be participating in classes with [Chaya Czernowin](http://www.schott-music.com/shop/persons/featured/38323/), [Hans Tutschku](http://www.tutschku.com/) and [Steven Takasugi](http://steventakasugi.com/), meeting fellow composers and working with the [Talea Ensemble](http://taleaensemble.org/) on my new trio for bass clarinettist, cellist and percussionist, [_The Incredulity of St Thomas_](/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/), which will be performed on Sunday, 26 August.

Above, you see the sun setting on the Hudson River from Manhattan, while the picture below shows a screen that is currently showing [_One11 and 103_](http://thehighline.org/about/public-art/cage), a video and sound work by John Cage, which I stumbled upon in the Highline — the raised railway track in the Meatpacking District, which has been converted into a wonderful park.
