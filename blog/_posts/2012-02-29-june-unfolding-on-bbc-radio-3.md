During the interval of BBC Radio 3’s [live concert broadcast on Friday 2 March](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01c9s2q), you can hear me talking to [King Edward Musical Society](http://www.kems.org.uk) chairman Tim Ward about my orchestral work _[June Unfolding](/2011/04/june-unfolding/)_, which they premiered last summer as part of the celebrations for the 750th anniversary of the royal charter of Macclesfield. The piece was written as part of Sound and Music, Making Music and PRS for Music Foundation’s _[Adopt a Composer](http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com/Partnerships/Residencies/Adopt-a-Composer)_ project, so many thanks go to them for pairing me up with KEMS. As well as us talking, you’ll also get to hear some excerpts of my piece and about the collaboration between [Andrew Hall](http://www.andrewhallmusic.co.uk/Home.html) and [Essex Symphony Orchestra](http://essexsymphony.org.uk/). Listen in!
