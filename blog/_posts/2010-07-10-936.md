> To grasp the world of today we are using a language made for the world of yesterday. And the life of the past seems a better reflection of our nature, for the simple reason that it is a better reflection of our language.

— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (trans. William Rees), _[Wind, Sand and Stars](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/wind-sand-and-stars/9780141183190)_
