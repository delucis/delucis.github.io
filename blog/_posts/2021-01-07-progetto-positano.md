It was a lovely surprise last year to receive a phone call from
[ensemble mosaik][em]’s Lisa Nolte, asking if I would take part in their
fellowship programme [Progetto Positano][pp] in 2021. In a year marked by
cancellations and professional uncertainty, having this project to look
forward to was more important than ever and I’m excited to continue our
collaboration that last produced [_I began the day inside the world trying to look at it, but it was lying on my face, making it hard to see._][ibtd]

Since 2017, in partnership with the [Ernst von Siemens Musikstiftung][evs],
ensemble mosaik has been offering composers the opportunity to spend a month
working on their music at the [Wilhelm Kempff Kulturstiftung][wkk]’s
Casa Orfeo in Positano, Italy, and to collaborate with the ensemble’s musicians,
with the results presented in an autumn concert in Berlin.

mosaik have worked flat out throughout these
difficult months to keep performing safely wherever possible, so against the
odds they were able to give their 2020 Progetto Positano concert in October,
featuring music by [Wojtek Blecharz][wb] and [Sara Glojnarić][sg]. It was a
magical concert — a magic only partly attributable to it being the first
concert I had attended in six months — beautifully balancing the two composers’
very different musical worlds, making full use of the spatial opportunities
offered by the [St. Elisabeth-Kirche][sek], and framing each piece with
electronics and video to draw my attention fluidly through the whole experience.

To give a flavour, here is Sara Glojnarić’s phenomenal _#popfem&nbsp;2_, which cuts
footage from the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas
with the same rapid-fire energy that her music displays, simultaneously
deploying the archive material as a means to bear witness and subverting it
to make her own forceful point.

It will be a challenge contributing to a concert as well put together as
October’s, but I look forward to attempting to do so and sharing this
platform with fellow composer [Liisa Hirsch][lh] and all of ensemble mosaik’s
musicians.
