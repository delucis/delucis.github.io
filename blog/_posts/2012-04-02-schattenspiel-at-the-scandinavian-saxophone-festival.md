After premiering _Schattenspiel_ [Update, 12/4: now titled [_something golden in the night_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/03/something-golden-in-the-night/)] with saxophonist Haruka Inoue at IRCAM on Saturday night, I am in Drammen, Norway, for tonight’s performance of the same piece by Australian saxophonist [Joshua Hyde](http://www.joshuahyde.com) at this year’s [Scandinavian Saxophone Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/314723328551145/). The festival runs all week and features above all a series of masterclasses for young saxophonists. Tonight’s concert is titled ‘Saxophone Today’ and Josh is also playing works by [Sam Andreyev](http://trepex.org), [Chris Dench](http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/dench-chris), [Liza Lim](http://lizalimcomposer.wordpress.com/), [Dai Fujikura](http://www.daifujikura.com/), [Philip Venables](http://philipvenables.com/), Bruno Maderna and Luciano Berio. I’m also looking forward to the ‘Late Night In C’ on Wednesday, though I might need my earplugs…
