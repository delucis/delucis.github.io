Tonight, Rane Moore (bass clarinet), Chris Gross (cello) and Alex Lipowski (percussion) of [Talea Ensemble](http://taleaensemble.org/) with conductor Eduardo Leandro will give the first performance of my new trio [_The Incredulity of St Thomas_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/) at Harvard University’s [John Knowles Paine Concert Hall](http://music.fas.harvard.edu/painehall.html). Also on the programme are new works by fellow composers at the [Harvard Summer Composition Institute](http://summercompositioninstitute.org/) [Clara Iannotta](http://soundcloud.com/claraiannotta/tracks), [Ray Evanoff](http://rayevanoff.wordpress.com/), [Thatchatham Silsupan](http://soundcloud.com/big-thatchatham), Carolyn Chen and [Sanzhar Baiterekov](http://soundcloud.com/sanzharbaiterekov). A second concert follows on Sunday, featuring music by Ran Duan, [Brian Griffeath-Loeb](http://bgloeb.com/), [Justin Hoke](http://www.justinhoke.com/), [Mauricio Pauly](http://www.mauriciopauly.com/), [Robert Phillips](http://soundcloud.com/rphillips-1) and [Katherine Young](http://katherineyoung.info/). Both concerts are free and are complemented in the afternoon by discussions of various topics from 12:30pm in the Music Department.

The past two weeks have been an intensely valuable experience — from the discussion in the anachronistic surroundings of Concord’s Colonial Inn last week to the seminars at Harvard Music Department this week. The hard work of Chaya Czernowin, Hans Tutschku, Steven Takasugi and Michelle Lou in making us welcome and organising the finest of details to create a warm and trusting environment of exchange is quite frankly inspirational.
