Followed by some general paragraph text that will fill a few lines by rambling around in circles without ever saying anything of any particular importance and ensuring that it is able to expand across the screen in tidy markings of dark on light as a hen’s foot scatters grain.

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end

{% highlight javascript %}
function notifydeleted() {
  // make sure our deleted instance ID still matches the ID stored
  // in the dictionary before running notifydeleted() functions
  if(instantiationFlags.get(modulename)) {
    testid = instantiationFlags.get(modulename);
    if(testid == instanceID) {
      // YOUR ON-DELETION FUNCTIONS GO HERE
      post(modulename, "has been deleted.\n");
      flagsOff();
    }
