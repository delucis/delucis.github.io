I’m going to Berlin for a few days, including a visit to [S.LOW Projekt](http://s.low-low.org/)’s [fourth week](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=139328946100186), which features the latest in [Sam Salem](http://www.osamahsalem.co.uk/) and [Patrick Sanan](http://windfarmmusic.wordpress.com/)’s Pond Life series of audiovisual installations as well as talks by a bunch of musicians, artists and technicians. Should be fun…
