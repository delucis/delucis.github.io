[Raise Your Voice Collective](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/), which I help run, have just [announced the line-up for their second outing](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/2010/04/line-up-announced/) of contemporary classical, experimental electronics and chilled-out beats at Centro Bar in Manchester’s Northern Quarter. It’s an exciting mix, stretching from [Martin Suckling](http://www.martinsuckling.com/)’s _Passacaglie_ for cello and electronics originally written to make use of the [Hyperbow developed at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/violin.html), via the sordidly urban angular lines and irregular rhythms of [Tom Coult](http://www.tomcoult.com/)’s _Avian Riots_, to [Steve Pycroft](http://www.stevepycroft.com/)’s _Richter VS Dragon_, which applies re-mixing and mash-up techniques to instrumental music, and ending with a live DJ set from [Al Sonar](http://www.myspace.com/bluntmedia) of [Hit&Run](http://www.hitandrunuk.com/). Also among the pieces being played will be my piece [_The Golden Lion Hotel_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2010/04/the-golden-lion-hotel/) for percussion and electronics.

The night is **Friday 14 May** and takes place as part of the [FutureEverything](http://www.futureeverything.org/) Festival Showcase. Check out the [Raise Your Voice website](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/) for more details.
