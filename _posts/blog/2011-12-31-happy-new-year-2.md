Last year I put together a [lengthy look at good stuff I’d seen, heard and read](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2010/12/2010-a-miscellany/). To close this year, here are some much briefer notes on some of the best things I encountered in the last 12 months.

**[Richard Craig](http://www.richardcraig.net/), _Inward_** — Without a doubt the best disc of new music I’ve heard this year, as [the Rambler foretold](http://johnsonsrambler.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/the-first-essential-new-music-cd-of-2011/). Either [Spotify it](http://open.spotify.com/album/1WoN8fGpRTSQGZrC5ynaJu) or [buy it](http://www.divine-art.co.uk/CD/28517info.htm) now.

**[Dmitri Kourliandski](http://www.kourl.ru), _Negative Modulations_** — One of the first concerts I heard after moving to Paris in September was by the young ensemble [Le Balcon](http://lebalcon.com/). They introduced me to this wonderful ensemble, electronics and video piece. [Here’s an mp3.](http://www.kourl.ru/Resources/Negative_modulation_venice_edit.mp3)

**Evan Parker, Peter Evans & Okkyung Lee** — Parker’s reputation barely needs any burnishing and [performing in this trio in November](http://www.instantschavires.com/spip.php?article481) he was liquid brilliance as was to be expected, but it was young American trumpeter [Peter Evans](http://iceorg.org/about/artist/evans) who really shone. Improvising at its best.

**Helmut Lachenmann / EIC, _Concertini _**— [Ensemble Intercontemporain](http://www.ensembleinter.com/)’s performance of Lachenmann’s spatialised ensemble work _Concertini_ at the end of November reminded me that he is without equal.

**Drew Baker, _[microscript](http://drewbakermusic.bandcamp.com/track/microscript)_** — This 10-minute work, played here by Chicago’s [Ensemble Dal Niente](http://dalniente.com/), was one of my favourite recordings found online this year.

2011 was really notable for being a year when I finally found time to read some of my stack of waiting books. If you pick anything to read in 2012, make it **David Foster Wallace’s _[Infinite Jest](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349121087/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chrisswith-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0349121087)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=chrisswith-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0349121087)_**. There is no question in my mind that it is one of the most wonderful books of the 20th Century and at just one thousand pages long, at least a thousand too short.




See you in 2012!
