I’m very excited to be able to announce that this year I will be taking part in the [Adopt a Composer](http://www.adoptacomposer.org/) scheme, funded by the [PRS for Music Foundation](http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com/) and run by [Sound and Music](http://www.soundandmusic.org/), in association with [Making Music](http://www.makingmusic.org.uk/). The scheme pairs up composers with amateur ensembles to collaborate on new music and I am delighted that I will be working with the orchestra of [King Edward Musical Society](http://www.kems.org.uk/) in Macclesfield.

In the coming months I will be getting to know the orchestra and working with conductor Tony Houghton and my composition mentor for the project, [David Horne](http://www.davidhorne.net/). This collaborative process will result in a performance on Saturday 18 June 2011 at St Michael and All Angels Church, part of the [Macclesfield Barnaby Festival](http://www.barnabyfestival.org.uk/) and the celebration of the 750th anniversary of the town’s royal charter. It will be my first work for orchestra, an exciting learning process — quite possibly for the orchestra as much as for me — and I’m looking forward to it immensely.
