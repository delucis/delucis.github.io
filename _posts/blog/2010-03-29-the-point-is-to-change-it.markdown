> “If we remain grotesquely unequal, we shall lose all sense of fraternity: and fraternity, for all its fatuity as a political objective, turns out to be the necessary condition of politics itself.”

I've just got round to finishing Tony Judt's excellent essay on the importance of the state printed in the Guardian Review the weekend before last. Read the [whole thing](http://bit.ly/99WS3D). Judt suffers from a motor neurone disorder, which was the subject of [an interview](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jan/09/tony-judt-motor-neurone-disease) and [an essay](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jan/09/tony-judt-motor-neuron-disorder) also published in the Guardian earlier this year.
