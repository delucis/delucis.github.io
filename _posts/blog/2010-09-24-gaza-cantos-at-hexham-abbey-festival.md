Fantastic violist Emma Richards will be performing my short piece [_Gaza Cantos_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2009/05/gaza-cantos/) at a lunchtime concert on Thursday 30 September as part of [Hexham Abbey Festival of Music & Arts](http://www.hexhamabbey.org.uk/festival/). The programme also includes Robert Schumann’s _Märchenbilder_, Johannes Brahms’s F minor Sonata and movements from a transcription of the first Bach cello suite.
