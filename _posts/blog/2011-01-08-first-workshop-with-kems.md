My first workshop with the orchestra of [King Edward Musical Society](http://www.kems.org.uk/) is on Tuesday — 11.1.11! — and I’m looking forward to playing around with some semi-improvised experiments mixing traditional notation and graphical elements that will hopefully let us create some interesting coincidences and arrays of interacting lines. I will post something about how it goes over on [the Adopt a Composer blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20110223143816/http://www.adoptacomposer.org/) next week, but in the meantime why not read about the experiences so far of the other composers involved.
