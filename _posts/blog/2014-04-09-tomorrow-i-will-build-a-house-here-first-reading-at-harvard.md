At 11:30 this Saturday morning at Harvard University, my duo for flute and cello, _[Tomorrow I will build a house here, if I can hold still](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2014/03/tomorrow-i-will-build-a-house-here-if-i-can-hold-still/)_, will be presented by Jessi Rosinski and David Russell of the [Callithumpian Consort](http://www.callithumpian.org) as part of my and fellow first-year PhD candidate Kai Polzhofer’s jury examination. Our pieces will be performed and discussed with faculty and peers. Despite its odd timing, the performance is open to the public and all are welcome!
