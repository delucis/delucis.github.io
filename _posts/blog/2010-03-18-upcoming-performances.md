I am currently working on a new work for clarinet, cello, piano and handheld percussion to be premiered on Friday 30th April at 17:30 by players from [Psappha](http://www.psappha.com/) new music ensemble.

[_Mikrokonzert: I Swear I Saw the Sun Falling_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2009/06/mikrokonzert-2/), written last year, will be performed by new music ensemble [Vaganza](http://www.vaganza.manchester.ac.uk/) on 16th May at the [York Spring Festival of New Music](http://www.yorkspringfestival.co.uk/) and on 8th June at the [RNCM](http://www.rncm.ac.uk/).
