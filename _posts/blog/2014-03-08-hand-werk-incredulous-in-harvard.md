On Saturday, 8 March, Cologne-based ensemble [hand werk](http://ensemble-handwerk.eu/) are giving the first of the [Harvard Group for New Music](http://hgnm.org)’s concerts for the year. In a mammoth programme that includes works by my colleagues here [Sivan Cohen-Elias](https://soundcloud.com/sivan-cohen-elias), [Marta Gentilucci](http://martagentilucci.com/), [Justin Hoke](http://www.justinhoke.com/), [Tim McCormack](http://www.timothy-mccormack.com/), [Manuela Meier](http://mm.mur.at/), [Marek Poliks](http://www.marekpoliks.com/), [Ian Power](http://ianpoweromg.tumblr.com/), and [Sabrina Schroeder](http://sabrinaschroeder.com/), they will play my trio [_The Incredulity of St Thomas_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/). Many thanks go to Heather Roche, Niklas Seidl, and Jonathan Hepfer for all their hard work and also to the HGNM team for making this happen.[^iwdaside]

[^iwdaside]: In past years on this day I have [posted](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/03/where-are-the-women-in-your-local-music-scene-paris-edition/) [something](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2011/03/where-are-the-women-in-your-local-music-scene/) to mark [International Women’s Day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com/). As I haven’t had time to put together anything this year, suffice it to say it’s a pleasure to be marking the day with a surprisingly balanced concert for once!
