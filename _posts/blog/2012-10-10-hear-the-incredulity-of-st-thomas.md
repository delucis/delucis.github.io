In August, [Talea Ensemble](http://taleaensemble.org/) gave the first performance of _[The Incredulity of St Thomas](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/06/the-incredulity-of-st-thomas/)_, for bass clarinettist, cellist and percussionist, as part of the [Harvard Summer Composition Institute](http://summercompositioninstitute.org). You can now stream or download their performance above. Many thanks to Rane, Chris, Alex and conductor Eduardo Leandro for their work on the piece, and to everyone else involved in those fantastic two weeks.
