I made this recording of birds in my garden at dawn on 22 April 2010. It was part of a whole heap of field recordings that I am only just sifting through. I’m afraid I can’t tell you what type of bird it is; I only ever spot blackbirds, magpies and, more recently, the occasional robin, but I don’t think it’s any of those.
