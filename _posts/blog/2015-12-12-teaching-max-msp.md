For the past semester I’ve been assisting [Hans Tutschku](http://www.tutschku.com/) with a class at Harvard University on improvisation with electronics, and we’ve been using [Max](https://cycling74.com/max/) as our main tool for the students to build their own electronic “instruments.” Faced with students ranging from Max beginners to more experienced programmers, and wanting to spend as much time as possible making music, we needed a solution that would allow us to teach Max and simultaneously start exploring performance.

I wanted to write up some of our experiences and describe how we got to the point where all the students could perform in a final concert featuring live electronics in just one semester.

#### Hardware Set-up

We realised we needed as simple and lightweight as possible a performance environment that students could plug into, which ended up forming small kits including a microphone, a single-input audio interface, a loudspeaker, and a [Korg nanoKONTROL2](http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/nanokontrol2/) MIDI controller. This set-up allowed instrumental input for live manipulation, and kept laptop performers’ audio discrete, clarifying who was producing which sounds.
