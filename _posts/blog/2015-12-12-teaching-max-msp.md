Teaching [Max](https://cycling74.com/max/) (a visual programming language for audio & video) is something that seems to be notoriously difficult. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard someone say “You just have to do [The Tutorials](https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/tutorials/00_maxindex)” in response to questions about how best to learn Max. The implication is that it must be learned alone. Max has admittedly developed into about as helpful a programming environment as possible with its tooltips and built-in reference, and books such as [those by Alessandro Cipriani & Maurizio Giri](http://www.virtual-sound.com/) can also help in exploring not just the programming but also the concepts behind digital signal processing. However, it seems wrong for various reasons to suggest students must learn by themselves.[^1]

  [^1]: For just one example, consider [this episode of NPR’s *Planet Money*](https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/tutorials/00_maxindex) which describes numbers of women studying computer science dropping off in the mid 80s as professors increasingly expected programming languages to have already been learned by students on their own.
