_This semester I am assisting [Hans Tutschku](http://www.tutschku.com/) with a class at Harvard University on improvisation with electronics. I asked several improvisers to choose pieces of music that are important to them and their practice._

First up is [**Richard Scott**](http://richard-scott.net/). Scott is a UK-born, Berlin-based composer and free improvising musician working with analogue modular synthesisers and alternative controllers, including pioneering work with the [Lightning controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Lightning) built by Don Buchla.

For our first instalment, Scott selected works by [Cabaret Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(band)), [Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis), and the [Spontaneous Music Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_Music_Ensemble).

##### Cabaret Voltaire, ‘Eddie’s Out’&nbsp;(1981)
