You will be able to hear my tape piece [_La leggerezza delle città_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2010/08/la-leggerezza-delle-citta/) in an exhibition of electroacoustic and soundscape compositions at the [Sonorous-Horreum](http://www.kapu.or.at/event/2011/09/05/soundscapes_special_ed_sonorous_horreum_0) listening room at the KAPU ([map](http://g.co/maps/62jv)) in Linz, Austria, 2–5 September as part of this year’s [Ars Electronica Festival](http://www.aec.at/festival/de/). The organisers describe the exhibition as:

> … an exhibition of sound works surrounded by concerts. International sound artists meet local compositions and the audience in a multichannel listening room — the “Sonorous-Horreum”. Sounds and noises that make us doubt in the darkness as at the same time we compose the landscape only by listening.

Many thanks go to [Clemens Pichler](http://www.fump.at/) and [Enrique Tomás](http://www.ultranoise.es/) for organising this.
