Two weeks ago [King Edward Musical Society](http://www.kems.org.uk/) premiered my orchestral piece, [_June Unfolding_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2011/04/june-unfolding/), written for the occasion — a special concert marking the 750th anniversary of Macclesfield’s Royal Charter. The result was recorded by BBC Radio 3 and will be broadcast later this year, but in the meantime, here is a short excerpt from the first half of the piece (which is around 12 minutes long in total) from a ‘bootleg’ recording by a friend. While listening, get a feel for the concert’s sights with [photos taken by Gareth Hacking on the night](http://garethhacking.blogspot.com/2011/06/kems-barnaby-concert.html), some of which I’ve also included below. Thanks again to everyone involved in making the night such a great success, from musicians to fire stewards.
