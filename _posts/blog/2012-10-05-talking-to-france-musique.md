You can hear a short interview with me and some extracts of my music this Monday evening on France Musique’s [_Les lundis de la contemporaine_](http://sites.radiofrance.fr/francemusique/em/lundi-contemporaine/emission.php?e_id=80000067&d_id=515002844&arch=1) broadcast. The interview took place a couple of weeks ago during [my stay at Fondation Royaumont](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2012/09/all-the-time-that-you-have-at-royaumont/) and for those of you who speak French, you can enjoy me stumbling into linguistic traps of accidental irreverence such as addressing interviewer Pierre Rigaudière with ‘tu’ rather than ‘vous’.

The magazine programme begins at 21:30 CET, following a broadcast of music by Philippe Manoury, Jonathan Harvey and Arnold Schönberg performed by the Lucerne Festival Academy Orchestra, and will be available to hear online until 7 November.
