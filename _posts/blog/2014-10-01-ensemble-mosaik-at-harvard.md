On Saturday, 4 October, Berlin-based [ensemble mosaik](http://ensemble-mosaik.de) are performing at Harvard University. The culmination of a weeklong residency, they are presenting new pieces by Trevor Bača and Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer as well as performances of some of Sivan Cohen-Elias and Stefan Prins’s most recent music. My latest piece, [_Tomorrow I will build a house here, if I can hold still_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2014/03/tomorrow-i-will-build-a-house-here-if-i-can-hold-still/), a duo for flute and cello, is also on the programme.

In my case, I can’t thank Bettina Junge and Mathis Mayr enough for their hard work and thoughtful rehearsal. It has been a real pleasure.
