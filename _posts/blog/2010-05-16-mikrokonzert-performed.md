My mini cello concerto [_Mikrokonzert: I Swear I Saw the Sun Falling_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2009/06/mikrokonzert-2/) received its premiere at [York Spring Festival of New Music](http://www.yorkspringfestival.co.uk/) on Sunday 16 May. Scored for solo cello, ensemble and electronics, this is a piece I wrote last year for friend and fantastic cellist Alice Purton and it was great to have her playing at the premiere with the [Vaganza](http://www.vaganza.manchester.ac.uk/) new music ensemble.
