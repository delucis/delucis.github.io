On Sunday, my tape piece from last summer inspired by the lightness and quickness of aural experience in urban spaces, [_La leggerezza delle città_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2010/08/la-leggerezza-delle-citta/), will be played as part of the 15th biannual [Manchester Theatre in Sound](http://www.mantisfestival.com/) (MANTIS) Festival. This edition bears the title ‘Manchester’s Sonic Meta-ontology’ and will explore Manchester’s sounds through a variety of concerts and installation pieces. You can find it [here on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=107309719349647).

On Monday, my solo piano work [_3 Sunsets_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2008/11/3-sunsets-2/) receives its second performance by good friend [Sebastian Grand](http://www.sebastiangrand.com/). He plays a programme of landscape-inspired works that also includes Ligeti’s _Arc-en-ciel_, Takemitsu’s _Rain Tree II_ and Cage’s _In a Landscape_ in a short afternoon recital at the Royal Academy of Music. It’s in the [David Josefowitz Recital Hall](http://bit.ly/fUmBB1) at 2pm.
