The most recent edition of the [CeReNeM Journal](http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/cerenem/journal/), run by postgraduates at the University of Huddersfield, contains an article I wrote about the painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Swedish composer [Lisa Streich](http://lisastreich.se/), exploring the trope of the Pietà in their works. Thanks go to [Pedro Alvarez](http://www.pedroalvarez.info/) for instigating the project and editing this volume, and to [Tim Rutherford-Johnson](http://www.redpen-bluepen.com/) for his eagle-eyed proof-reading.

Lisa’s music is wonderful, you should go listen to it, and as a small bonus if you are reading the article online, you can refer to [this selective timeline of Bouguereau’s paintings](http://chrisswithinbank.net/bouguereau/), which I created as an aid to my research.
