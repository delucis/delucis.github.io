Everyone in Manchester should come to the [International Anthony Burgess Foundation](http://www.anthonyburgess.org/) this Friday evening for what promises to be an exciting evening of new music, ranging from experimental new works to improvisation and jazz. The programme includes the UK première of my most recent work, [_Small Atlas_](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2011/05/small-atlas/) by the [Raise Your Voice Ensemble](http://www.raise-your-voice.org/)’s Jenny Dyson, Jon Guy, [Rebecca Lea](http://www.rebeccajanelea.co.uk/) and Aaron Parker alongside works by Steve Reich, Morton Feldman, Karlheinz Stockhausen and [Malcolm Hayes](http://www.malcolmhayes.co.uk/). The evening also features performances by good friends [Trio Atem](http://www.myspace.com/trioatem) — performing works by [Tom Coult](http://www.tomcoult.com/), more Feldman, [Ian Vine](http://www.ianvine.com/), Martin Iddon, Harrison Birtwistle, Toru Takemitsu, Georges Aperghis and [Michael Mayhew](http://www.michaelmayhew.com/) — and finishes with a set from the recently-formed [265 Quartet](http://efpirecords.com/artists/265-quartet/).
