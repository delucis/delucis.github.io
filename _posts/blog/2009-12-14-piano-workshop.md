Two new piano studies written as part of my Masters course will be workshopped alongside those of other Masters students by Richard Casey, winner of the [British Contemporary Piano Competition](http://www.britconpc.co.uk/) and founder-member of contemporary music ensemble [Psappha](http://www.psappha.com/), on Monday 14 December. The studies explore aspects of time and harmony, demanding traditional virtuosity of speed and agility, but also less extroverted skills in fragile use of colour and resonance.
