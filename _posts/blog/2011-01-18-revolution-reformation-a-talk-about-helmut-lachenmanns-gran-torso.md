#### A Talk About Helmut Lachenmann’s _Gran Torso_


For those of you in Manchester, I am giving a talk with the wonderful [Quatuor Danel](http://www.quatuordanel.eu/) this Thursday on Lachenmann’s first string quartet, _Gran Torso_. The talk runs from 14:30 to 16:00 at the University of Manchester ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=16576004986956447682)), but is preceded at 13:10 by a free lunchtime concert featuring Beethoven’s String Quartet in F major, Op. 18 No. 1, and the UK première of [Pierre Bartholomée](http://www.pierrebartholomee.com/)’s quartet _Envol et Mort d’un Papillon_. I will cover sound, structure and historical context as much as possible in the time available, as well as as briefly touching on the two later quartets, ‘Reigen seliger Geister’ and ‘Grido’.

The Danels are performing all three Lachenmann quartets in the coming months. _Gran Torso_ is [Friday night at 19:30](http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/martinharriscentre/mhceventspage.php?eventid=884) alongside Bartók 3 and Beethoven “Harp”. It is an incredible work, not to be missed.
