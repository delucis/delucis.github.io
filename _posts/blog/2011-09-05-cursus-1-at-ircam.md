As of today, I am studying on ‘Cursus 1’ at [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr/) in Paris. Over the next seven months, I will be following the curriculum covering all aspects of composition involving computers, culminating next spring in the creation of a new work for solo instrument and electronics. I am grateful for the support of an Entente Cordiale scholarship from the French state in continuing my studies.
