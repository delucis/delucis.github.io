This short work is part game piece, part physical performance, part sound. At the heart of it lies the question: what happens when we stop breathing? The exhaustion of a physical limit — the breath, the bow — is deployed as a mechanism controlling what we hear and how long we hear it for.

The original text is in French, there are also versions in English and German, and further translations to match singers’ mother tongues are very welcome.

*All the time that you have what we have. / All the time that you have.* was written as part of the ‘Voix nouvelles’ programme at Fondation Royaumont for Marie Picaut, YunPeng Zhao and Guillaume Latour. The transcription for mezzo-soprano and two violas was completed at the request of soundinitiative for Fabienne Séveillac, Winnie Huang and Emma Richards.
