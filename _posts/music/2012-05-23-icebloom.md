Taking ‘Frühlingstraum’ from Schubert’s _Winterreise_ as its starting point, _Icebloom_ is a miniature that attempts to address some of the relationships detailed in the song’s text. Wilhelm Müller’s poem presents a vignette of absence, imagination and memory, and it is the relationship between absence and presence that is glanced at in _Icebloom_’s brief moments: liminal sounds vaguely outline the ghosts of Schubert’s piano, and skeletal remnants drift through the thin hissing of the wind.

_Icebloom_ was originally written for the [Metapraxis Ensemble](http://metapraxisensemble.com/)’s Winterreise Project, was then workshopped by the [Curious Chamber Players](http://www.curiouschamberplayers.com/) for reading sessions at the [Impuls Academy 2013](http://www.impuls.cc/en/academy/), Graz, Austria, before receiving its first performance by [Longleash](http://longleashtrio.com/) in New York.
