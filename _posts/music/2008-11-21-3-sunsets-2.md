Written for Sebastian Grand, _3 Sunsets_ is made up of three  sharply contrasting miniatures aimed at establishing atmospheric  vignettes and examining various aspects of contemporary piano technique.  Each miniature examines extremes of speed and dynamic in a somewhat  alienated, but hopefully ghostly landscape.

_3 Sunsets_ was premiered on November 21 2008 by Sebastian Grand  in the [Cosmo  Rodewald Concert Hall](http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/martinharriscentre) at Manchester University as part of new music  ensemble [Vaganza](http://www.vaganza.manchester.ac.uk/)'s  day of concerts in celebration of composer Kevin Malone's 50th birthday.  The concerts featured contemporary American music from Crumb to Bolcom,  from Feldman to Kevin Malone himself, as well as music from student  composers within the University's Music Department.
