*union–seam* is the second in a series of experiments exploring physical connections and shared spaces between performers as the key determining factor for the work’s material and environment. The unstable space generated by a fluid instrumental apparatus in combination with the performers’ actions calls for a reliance upon and responsiveness to not just the other performers, but the instrumental assemblage as a whole.

*union–seam* adapts and extends *[local bond][574445d9]* for the JACK Quartet’s 2016 residency at Harvard University.
