*union|haze* continues a series of work, which poses questions about the
situated and material assemblages that constitute the performance. It attempts
to place a situation of severe material contingency — one which brings the
agency of all participants, including the non-human, to the fore — within layers
of a particulate fog.

*union|haze* embeds a diffracted hybrid of [*union–seam*][caaeef58] and
[*local bond*][65b29835], and was written for [ensemble recherche][bbd66f57]’s
residency at Harvard University.
