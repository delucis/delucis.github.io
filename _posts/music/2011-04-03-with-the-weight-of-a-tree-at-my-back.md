This short, two-movement work came out of an earlier work for solo viola, _[Gaza Cantos](http://www.chrisswithinbank.net/2009/05/gaza-cantos/)_, which was written after the invasion of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Defence Forces in December 2008. The title references Amir Nizar Zuabi’s play _[I am Yusuf and this is my brother](http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/jan/10/amir-nizar-zuabi-interview)_, set before and after ‘al Nakba’ in 1948. In one scene of this play, an old man stumbles on stage bearing a tree on his back, struggling under the weight. Having planted the tree and watched it grow, he cannot bear to leave it behind as he flees Israeli attacks — a visceral and poetic image of the uprooting of lives by violence. As with _Gaza Cantos_, my intention is not to cast judgement or even to criticise — believing there is no such thing as intrinsically political music — rather to provoke contemplation and thought.

_With the weight of a tree at my back_ was written for Jess Argall who premiered it in Falmouth, May 2011.
