Materials to­wards a per­form­ance for four people.

*ru­mour — dis­tant* land provides a frame­work for a per­form­ance that is as much visual and dra­matic as it is sonic, al­lowing four per­formers to present a series of im­ages and ac­tions, all of which touch around but never upon feel­ings of dis­tance, loss, re­min­is­cence and the mundane.
