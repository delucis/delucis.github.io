This short work is part game piece, part phys­ical per­form­ance, part sound. At the heart of it lies the ques­tion: what hap­pens when we stop breathing? The ex­haus­tion of a phys­ical limit — the breath, the bow — is de­ployed as a mech­anism con­trolling what we hear and how long we hear it for.

The ori­ginal text is in French, there are also ver­sions in English and German, and fur­ther trans­la­tions to match singers’ mother tongues are very welcome.

*All the time that you have what we have. / All the time that you have.* was written as part of the ‘Voix nou­velles’ pro­gramme at Fondation Royaumont for Marie Picaut, YunPeng Zhao and Guillaume Latour. The tran­scrip­tion for mezzo-soprano and two vi­olas was com­pleted at the re­quest of soundini­ti­ative for Fabienne Séveillac, Winnie Huang and Emma Richards.
