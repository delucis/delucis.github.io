Two things — a thousand things — meet face to face; two planets, the air on either side of a door, Leda and the Swan, Hemlock and Socrates, two hands, a river and the sea. Their orbits and collisions are history and life, the brushing and breaking of edges. _Bodies_, for oboe and piano, is about these meetings and resolutions, about the border between being and not-being, where one body ends and another starts.

_Bodies_ was premiered by Emily Sleightholme, oboe, and Keith McAlister, piano, on 11th March 2008 as part of the Distant Voices day focusing on the music of John White and Nina Whiteman at the [Martin Harris Centre for Music and Drama](http://www.arts.manchester.ac.uk/martinharriscentre/), Manchester.
