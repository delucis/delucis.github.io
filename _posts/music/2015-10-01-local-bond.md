*local bond* is the first in a series of works that explore physical connections and shared spaces between performers as the key determining factor for the work’s material and environment. The unstable space generated by a fluid instrumental apparatus in combination with the performers’ actions calls for a reliance upon and responsiveness to not just the other performers, but the instrumental assemblage as a whole.

Written for Stony Brook University’s [‘Premieres!’](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/music/premieres/premieres.html) concert, *local bond*’s first performance will be by the university’s Contemporary Chamber Players under the direction of Eduardo Leandro.
