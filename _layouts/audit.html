<h3>Some basic numbers</h3>

{% include audit_01_works.html %}

{% include audit_03_all-male.html %}

{% include audit_04_avg_prog.html %}

<h3>Performance frequency</h3>

<p>Some composers are more or less frequently performed: there seems to be a tendency for the few female composers that are performed ({{ composersF_total }} and counting) to be programmed relatively more frequently. This represents a further shrinking of the representation of female composers — the already small number of works performed come from an even smaller group of composers. Taking my own works out of the equation, works by female composers are <strong>{{ othersF_percent }}%</strong> of all works performed. Female composers on the other hand represent only <strong>{{ composersF_percent }}%</strong> of the composers programmed.</p>

{% include audit_02_frequency.html %}

<p>Unlike the other measures, this excludes my own performances, which of course hugely outnumber those of any other composer and distort this particular corpus of data.</p>

<h3>An overview of all the concerts</h3>

{% include audit_05_sparkline.html %}

<ul>
  <li>Just {% if parity_count == 1 %}<strong>{{ parity_count }} concert</strong> has{% else %}<strong>{{ parity_count }} concerts</strong> have{% endif %} featured a programme where half or more of the works are by female composers.</li>
  <li>On average just <strong>{{ worksperformedF_percent }}%</strong> of works played are by female composers.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>There are <strong>{{ nodata }} concerts</strong> missing programme data. These are ignored entirely in the statistics above.</p>
    <h3>Career progression</h3>
    <p>It is often stated that there is a gradual filtering out of women at every stage of career progression: from school-age music studies, throughout academic pathways, and later in professional contexts. Looking at my data, the proportion has never been excellent, but I can observe that in the 4 years I was an undergraduate and masters student at the University of Manchester — when the vast majority of my performances were in student contexts — <strong>{{ worksperformedF_percent_uni }}%</strong> of works performed were by female composers. Since then, just <strong>{{ worksperformedF_percent_since }}%</strong> have been, — a drop of {{ worksperformedF_percent_uni | minus: worksperformedF_percent_since | divided_by: worksperformedF_percent_uni | times: 100 | append: "" | truncate: 4, '' }}%.</p>
